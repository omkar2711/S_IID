Alcohol-impaired driving remains a significant public health concern, leading to numerous accidents, injuries, and fatalities on the roads. 
Traditional ignition interlock devices (IIDs) have been used to deter repeat DUI offenders, but their effectiveness can be limited due to lack of advanced features and functionalities.
In this abstract, we discuss the development of a smart IID that leverages cutting-edge technologies such as IoT and advanced sensor technologies to provide innovative solutions to prevent alcohol impaired driving.
The proposed IID requires the driver to pass a breathalyzer test before starting the vehicle, ensuring that their breath alcohol concentration (BAC) is below the legal limit. 
Real time monitoring allows for immediate alerts in case of DUI violations. 
The data collected by the IID can also be surveyed to recognize patterns and thus further help in eradicating drunk driving.
The smart IID also focuses on the user experience, providing an user-friendly interface, and intuitive control. Furthermore, additional functionalities such as GPS tracking, remote monitoring, and smartphone connectivity help in enhancing the userâ€™s experience.
The endmost objective of any smart IID is to improve road safety efficiently by preventing or altogether terminating alcohol-hindered drunk driving incidents.
