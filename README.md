    <h1>Smart Ignition Interlock Device (Smart IID)</h1>
    <p>Alcohol-impaired driving remains a significant public health concern, leading to numerous accidents, injuries, and fatalities on the roads. Traditional ignition interlock devices (IIDs) have been used to deter repeat DUI offenders, but their effectiveness can be limited due to a lack of advanced features and functionalities.</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>The proposed Smart IID requires the driver to pass a breathalyzer test before starting the vehicle, ensuring that their breath alcohol concentration (BAC) is below the legal limit. Real-time monitoring allows for immediate alerts in case of DUI violations. The data collected by the IID can also be analyzed to recognize patterns and further help in eradicating drunk driving.</p>
    <h3>Features</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Breathalyzer Test:</strong> Ensures the driver's BAC is below the legal limit before starting the vehicle.</li>
        <li><strong>Real-Time Monitoring:</strong> Provides immediate alerts in case of DUI violations.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Analysis:</strong> Utilizes collected data to recognize patterns and prevent drunk driving.</li>
        <li><strong>User-Friendly Interface:</strong> Offers an intuitive and user-friendly control panel.</li>
        <li><strong>GPS Tracking:</strong> Allows for tracking the vehicle's location.</li>
        <li><strong>Remote Monitoring:</strong> Enables remote access and monitoring.</li>
        <li><strong>Smartphone Connectivity:</strong> Connects with smartphones for added convenience.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Breathalyzer Test:</strong> The Smart IID requires the driver to blow into a breathalyzer. If the BAC is above the legal limit, the vehicle will not start.</li>
        <li><strong>Real-Time Monitoring:</strong> Once the vehicle is in operation, the Smart IID continuously monitors the driver's BAC. If it detects a rise in alcohol levels, it sends an immediate alert.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Analysis:</strong> All data collected by the Smart IID is stored and can be analyzed to identify patterns of behavior related to alcohol-impaired driving.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Usage</h2>
    <p>To use the Smart IID, follow the instructions provided in the <a href="user-manual.md">User Manual</a>.</p>
